The same legal form and rules must apply to all Parties, while the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be differentiated according to a Party's responsibility and capability.<br>...<br>Switzerland&rsquo;s understanding of a fair share includes consideration of the aspects below. It is to note that fairness considerations include various aspects and that no single indicator on its own can accurately reflect fairness or a globally equitable distribution of countries&rsquo; efforts. It is further to note that the evolving nature of a country&rsquo;s circumstances is to be reflected in fairness considerations.<br /> &bull; Responsibility is reflected in a country&rsquo;s past, current and future greenhouse gas emissions. Total emissions as well as per capita emissions are to be considered.<br /> Switzerland&rsquo;s responsibility in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is low: Today, Switzerland emits around 0.1% of world&rsquo;s emissions and per capita emissions are at world&rsquo;s average. Through climate policies implemented domestically, Switzerland&rsquo;s total share in global emissions as well as per capita emissions are further decreasing despite a substantial growth in industrial production (1990 &ndash; today: +54%) and population (1990 &ndash; today: +18%). Also, Switzerland has a low level of historic emissions of around 0.2% since 1990.<br /> &bull; Capacity to contribute to solving the climate problem is closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures, such as carbon-efficient technologies. Hence, one aspect of capacity is to take into account GDP per capita in fairness considerations.<br /> &bull; Cost-efficient mitigation potential and abatement costs are a core aspect in considering a fair contribution of a country. Abatement costs vary strongly across countries. It is also to note, that marginal abatement costs increase if a country has undertaken ambitious mitigation actions in the past. In fairness considerations, it is important to merit past efforts and reward early movers.<br /> In Switzerland, abatement costs are high due to the limited availability of short term cost-efficient mitigation potential: Switzerland&rsquo;s energy production is nearly carbon free and there is little heavy industry. Emission reduction potential mostly remains in the housing and transport sectors. This remaining potential has long transformation periods.<br /> Switzerland is committed to continue to contribute its fair share in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in view of holding the increase in global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and to continue to act on the forefront of climate change.<br /> ","<p>(The information on fairness and ambition was communicated in a combined section in the INDC and was separated based on the content.)</p>It is to note that Switzerland&rsquo;s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 relative to 1990 levels puts Switzerland on an emission development pathway in line with the recommendations by science. <br /> It is further to note that Switzerland&rsquo;s emission reductions by 2030 will mainly be achieved domestically, thereby further strengthening Switzerland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy. Given the low greenhouse gas intensity of Switzerland today, a high level of ambition is underlying Switzerland&rsquo;s INDC for 2030.",Switzerland&rsquo;s commitment to reduce emissions by 50 percent by 2030 relative to 1990 levels puts Switzerland on an emission development pathway that corresponds with the recommendations of the IPCC AR5 to reduce global emissions by minus 40 to 70 percent by 2050 below 2010 levels. The formulated commitment by 2030 is further consistent with the longer term vision of the Government of Switzerland to reduce per capita emissions to 1 &ndash; 1.5 t CO<sub>2</sub>eq in Switzerland. These unavoidable emissions will have to be eventually compensated through sinks or removals. It is to note that Switzerland's per capita emissions were already at world average levels in 2010.,Not Specified,Not Specified,"<p><strong>Information on Switzerland</strong></p> <p>Switzerland&rsquo;s share in global greenhouse gas emissions is around 0.1 percent. In 2012, total greenhouse gas emissions of Switzerland equaled 51.4 million tCO<sub>2</sub>eq and per capita emissions were at world&rsquo;s average (6.4 tCO<SUB>2</SUB>eq). The biggest share of greenhouse gas emissions arises from the transport and building sectors, followed by the industry, agriculture and waste sectors (see figure 1).</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for Figure 1. Switzerland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by sectors in 2012.]</p> <p>Over the last 25 years, Switzerland has experienced substantial economic and population growth. These two parameters influence the consumption and production of energy, traffic volumes and the number and volumes of heated buildings, which strongly impact greenhouse gas emissions in almost all sectors. Compared to 1990, in 2012, Switzerland&rsquo;s real gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of economic output had risen by 36 percent, the building space that had to be heated increased by 31 percent, over 36 percent more passenger cars were in circulation on Swiss roads and 19 percent more people lived in Switzerland. Greenhouse gas emissions in this period nevertheless decreased slightly: new buildings are better insulated than in the past, cars have become more fuel efficient, heating oil is increasingly replaced by natural gas and electricity (e.g. for heat pumps) and the trend away from petrol- to diesel-powered passenger cars also contributed to a reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Figures 2 and 3 show the respective reduction over the period 1990 to 2012 in per capita emissions by approximately 20%, in emissions per GDP by close to 30% as well as the decoupling of economic growth from the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for Figure 2. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions 1990 &ndash; 2012]</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for &nbsp;Figure 3. Per GDP greenhouse gas emissions 1990 &ndash; 2012]</p> <p>Switzerland has long standing climate policies and since 2000 a specific CO<SUB>2</SUB> Act has been established. Switzerland has committed itself under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) and reached its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared to 1990, including through the use of carbon credits. At the beginning of 2013, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> Act and the CO<SUB>2</SUB> Ordinance entered into force in revised form. They form the framework of the current Swiss climate policy for the period from 2013 to 2020. The desired reduction of emissions by 2020 of 20 % below 1990 levels requires decisive action. Ratification of Switzerland&rsquo;s commitment from 2013 till 2020 under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is currently under consideration by the Parliament. For the period from 2021 to 2030, the existing legal frameworks will have to be revised. These revisions are envisaged in the next few years and subject to approval by Parliament. Climate change has already left many marks in Switzerland. Both, the economy and society are affected. Since the beginning of temperature measurements in Switzerland in 1864, the average annual temperature has risen by 1.75 &deg;C. In the Alps, the glaciers have been retreating at an accelerating pace since 1980. Since 1999 alone, glaciers have lost over 12 percent of their volume. If the warming continues, only a fraction of the current glacier cover will be left by the end of the 21st century with large impacts on the seasonal availability of water for drinking water, agriculture and power generation. Parallel to the retreat of glaciers, the permanently frozen subsoil in the high mountains also continues to thaw. More frequent mountain and rock falls as well as debris slides that can endanger transport links and infrastructure in the high mountains are a result of this. Already today, large investments are necessary to secure infrastructures at higher elevations. People are also directly affected. Only recently has it also been recognized that even the slow but steady increase in daily temperatures has a demonstrable impact on the well-being of people. Daily maximum temperatures in Switzerland have risen steadily since 1960. Hotter than usual summers have already led to higher mortalities.</p> <p>Switzerland remains committed to and striving for an ambitious international agreement on climate change in line with recommendations by science to hold average global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius.</p>","<a href=""http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Switzerland/1/15%2002%2027_INDC%20Contribution%20of%20Switzerland.pdf"" target=""_blank""><i class=""fa fa-link""></i>&nbsp;View the submission</a>",02/27/15 12:15,03-26-15

The strategies focus on coastal management, such as establishing a legal framework, tools for data collection and training and information.</p> <p><em>Cette strat&eacute;gie consacre l&rsquo;engagement du Gabon &agrave; agir contre les changements climatiques en prenant en compte l&rsquo;adaptation de son territoire aux effets de ceux-ci.</em><br />Gabon's commitment to take action against climate change recognizes the need to take adaptation into account.</p>","<p><em>Cette soumission sera enrichie d&rsquo;ici &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence pour le Climat d&rsquo;annexes d&eacute;taillant plus pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment les sc&eacute;narios et les mesures pr&eacute;vues par le Gabon pour suivre et tenir ses engagements.</em><br />This submission will be revised by the Conference for Climate and Gabon will provide more precise detail regarding the scenarios and policies that it will need for tracking and keeping its commitments.</p> <p>(Gabon discusses financing in Annex H.

Le Fonds permettra de canaliser et stimuler une partie des flux financiers d&eacute;di&eacute;s &agrave; la r&eacute;duction des &eacute;missions et plus largement au D&eacute;veloppement Durable : (1) budget de l&rsquo;Etat, (2) investissements priv&eacute;s, (3) revenus des cr&eacute;dits du march&eacute; domestique, (4) apports ou pr&ecirc;ts de bailleurs de fonds).</em></p> <p>The sustainable development law sets up national funds for sustainable development. The creation of these funds may help Gabon to learn from national climate funds in other countries while keeping in mind Gabon&rsquo;s strategy. The funds will channel and boost some of the financial flows dedicated to reducing emissions and more generally towards sustainable development: (1) state budget, (2) private investments, (3) revenue from credits resulting from domestic market-based instrument, (4) loans</p> <p><em>En dehors de ce m&eacute;canisme en voie de construction &agrave; la suite de la promulgation de la Loi en ao&ucirc;t 2014, le Plan Climat en 2013 d&eacute;nombrait un certain nombre d&rsquo;autres dispositions r&eacute;glementaires pouvant potentiellement contribuer financi&egrave;rement &agrave; la r&eacute;duction des &eacute;missions de GHG (certificats verts, syst&egrave;me de bonus/malus etc.).
