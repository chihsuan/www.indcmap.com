In 2012, total greenhouse gas emissions of Switzerland equaled 51.4 million tCO<sub>2</sub>eq and per capita emissions were at world&rsquo;s average (6.4 tCO<SUB>2</SUB>eq). The biggest share of greenhouse gas emissions arises from the transport and building sectors, followed by the industry, agriculture and waste sectors (see figure 1).</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for Figure 1. Switzerland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by sectors in 2012.]</p> <p>Over the last 25 years, Switzerland has experienced substantial economic and population growth. These two parameters influence the consumption and production of energy, traffic volumes and the number and volumes of heated buildings, which strongly impact greenhouse gas emissions in almost all sectors. Compared to 1990, in 2012, Switzerland&rsquo;s real gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of economic output had risen by 36 percent, the building space that had to be heated increased by 31 percent, over 36 percent more passenger cars were in circulation on Swiss roads and 19 percent more people lived in Switzerland. Greenhouse gas emissions in this period nevertheless decreased slightly: new buildings are better insulated than in the past, cars have become more fuel efficient, heating oil is increasingly replaced by natural gas and electricity (e.g. for heat pumps) and the trend away from petrol- to diesel-powered passenger cars also contributed to a reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Figures 2 and 3 show the respective reduction over the period 1990 to 2012 in per capita emissions by approximately 20%, in emissions per GDP by close to 30% as well as the decoupling of economic growth from the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for Figure 2. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions 1990 &ndash; 2012]</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for &nbsp;Figure 3. Per GDP greenhouse gas emissions 1990 &ndash; 2012]</p> <p>Switzerland has long standing climate policies and since 2000 a specific CO<SUB>2</SUB> Act has been established. Switzerland has committed itself under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) and reached its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared to 1990, including through the use of carbon credits. At the beginning of 2013, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> Act and the CO<SUB>2</SUB> Ordinance entered into force in revised form. They form the framework of the current Swiss climate policy for the period from 2013 to 2020. The desired reduction of emissions by 2020 of 20 % below 1990 levels requires decisive action. Ratification of Switzerland&rsquo;s commitment from 2013 till 2020 under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is currently under consideration by the Parliament. For the period from 2021 to 2030, the existing legal frameworks will have to be revised. These revisions are envisaged in the next few years and subject to approval by Parliament. Climate change has already left many marks in Switzerland. Both, the economy and society are affected. Since the beginning of temperature measurements in Switzerland in 1864, the average annual temperature has risen by 1.75 &deg;C. In the Alps, the glaciers have been retreating at an accelerating pace since 1980. Since 1999 alone, glaciers have lost over 12 percent of their volume. If the warming continues, only a fraction of the current glacier cover will be left by the end of the 21st century with large impacts on the seasonal availability of water for drinking water, agriculture and power generation. Parallel to the retreat of glaciers, the permanently frozen subsoil in the high mountains also continues to thaw. More frequent mountain and rock falls as well as debris slides that can endanger transport links and infrastructure in the high mountains are a result of this. Already today, large investments are necessary to secure infrastructures at higher elevations. People are also directly affected. Only recently has it also been recognized that even the slow but steady increase in daily temperatures has a demonstrable impact on the well-being of people. Daily maximum temperatures in Switzerland have risen steadily since 1960. Hotter than usual summers have already led to higher mortalities.</p> <p>Switzerland remains committed to and striving for an ambitious international agreement on climate change in line with recommendations by science to hold average global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius.</p>",
