It\u2019s emphasized that all the emission reduction will be conducted voluntarily within the region instead of using credits from international mechanism. However, the percentage and the calculation in terms of Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry are both rather vague. As a result, this weakens the intended commitment from EU.\nOn the other hand, EU did not address the important issues such as technology, trade, climate financing and adaptation plan in its INDC. Additionally, EU proposed during the previous negotiation that the new agreement ought to include a \"5-year periodic review\" mechanism as a proposal. Nevertheless, the mitigation pledges for 2025 are not included in its INDC.",

Also, adaptation plan including establishing climate resilient infrastructure, building early alert system, and reaching zero deforestation by 2030 are all included in the Mexican INDC.",

However, according to the suggestion from IPCC, the mitigation pledges from Switzerland only reaches the lowest criteria of its reduction capability and responsibility. In addition, Switzerland will include Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry into its mitigation framework. On top of that, carbon credits from international mechanism will partly be used. This indicates that the domestic emission reduction within Switzerland would not cover the majority of total expected emission reduction.",

Since the United States withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, its passive attitude toward climate change has suffered a lot of criticism. However, things start to change after President Obama stepped up. In addition to the joint climate statement made with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping during 2014 APEC, in March 2015, Obama also announced that the federal government itself committinghas to reduce 40% of greenhouse gas emission by 2025 compared to 2005.the emission in 2025 to the level which is 40% less than that in 2005, This actionto demonstrates for other domestic carbon emission sector, hoping to get the dominance of negotiations in COP21. All these actions show the relatively active attitude of Obama government toward climate change, and its eagerness to gain an advantageous status during COP21 taking place later in the year.",
